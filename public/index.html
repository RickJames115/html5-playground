    <!--Differences Between SVG and Canvas
SVG is a language for describing 2D graphics in XML.

Canvas draws 2D graphics, on the fly (with a JavaScript).

SVG is XML based, which means that every element is available within the SVG DOM. You can attach JavaScript event handlers for an element.

In SVG, each drawn shape is remembered as an object. If attributes of an SVG object are changed, the browser can automatically re-render the shape.

Canvas is rendered pixel by pixel. In canvas, once the graphic is drawn, it is forgotten by the browser.

If its position should be changed, the entire scene needs to be redrawn, including any objects that might have been covered by the graphic.

-->

      <!--  Comparison of Canvas and SVG
The table below shows some important differences between Canvas and SVG:

Canvas:	
Resolution dependent
No support for event handlers
Poor text rendering capabilities
You can save the resulting image as .png or .jpg
Well suited for graphic-intensive games

SVG:
Resolution independent
Support for event handlers
Best suited for applications with large rendering areas (Google Maps)
Slow rendering if complex (anything that uses the DOM a lot will be slow)
Not suited for game applications

        <!--   Google Maps allows you to display maps on your web page.

        <!-- HTML5 Video Example

            Before HTML5, a video could only be played in a browser with a plug-in (like flash).

      The HTML5 <video> element specifies a standard way to embed a video in a web page.

            <video width="320" height="240" controls>
  <source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

           * How it Works *
The controls attribute adds video controls, like play, pause, and volume.

It is a good idea to always include width and height attributes. If height and width are not set, the page might flicker while the video loads.

The <source> element allows you to specify alternative video files which the browser may choose from. The browser will use the first recognized format.

The text between the <video> and </video> tags will only be displayed in browsers that do not support the <video> element.
           
            
             To start a video automatically use the autoplay attribute:
                                               |
                                             vvvvv
                                               v
            <video width="320" height="240" autoplay>
  <source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
            The autoplay attribute does not work in mobile devices like iPad and iPhone.

            HTML Video - Browser Support
In HTML5, there are 3 supported video formats: MP4, WebM, and Ogg.

The browser support for the different formats is:

Browser	     MP4	WebM	Ogg
Internet
Explorer	YES	     NO  	NO
Chrome	    YES	     YES	YES
Firefox	    YES      YES	YES
Safari	    YES	     NO 	NO
Opera	    YES 	 YES	YES
      (from Opera 25)

            HTML Video - Methods, Properties, and Events
HTML5 defines DOM methods, properties, and events for the <video> element.

This allows you to load, play, and pause videos, as well as setting duration and volume.

There are also DOM events that can notify you when a video begins to play, is paused, etc.

            Example: Using JavaScript
            ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

            <div style="text-align:center">
  <button onclick="playPause()">Play/Pause</button>
  <button onclick="makeBig()">Big</button>
  <button onclick="makeSmall()">Small</button>
  <button onclick="makeNormal()">Normal</button>
  <br><br>
  <video id="video1" width="420">
    <source src="mov_bbb.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    <source src="mov_bbb.ogg" type="video/ogg">
    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
  </video>
</div>

<script>
var myVideo = document.getElementById("video1");

function playPause() {
    if (myVideo.paused)
        myVideo.play();
    else
        myVideo.pause();
}

function makeBig() {
    myVideo.width = 560;
}

function makeSmall() {
    myVideo.width = 320;
}

function makeNormal() {
    myVideo.width = 420;
}
</script>

      <!--  HTML5 Audio

          Audio on the Web
Before HTML5, audio files could only be played in a browser with a plug-in (like flash).

The HTML5 <audio> element specifies a standard way to embed audio in a web page.

        The HTML <audio> Element

          <audio controls>
  <source src="horse.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
  <source src="horse.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">

          HTML Audio - How It Works
The controls attribute adds audio controls, like play, pause, and volume.

The <source> element allows you to specify alternative audio files which the browser may choose from. The browser will use the first recognized format.

The text between the <audio> and </audio> tags will only be displayed in browsers that do not support the <audio> element.

          HTML Audio - Browser Support
In HTML5, there are 3 supported audio formats: MP3, Wav, and Ogg.

The browser support for the different formats is: 

Browser	    MP3	    Wav	   Ogg
