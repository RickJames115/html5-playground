    <!--Differences Between SVG and Canvas
SVG is a language for describing 2D graphics in XML.

Canvas draws 2D graphics, on the fly (with a JavaScript).

SVG is XML based, which means that every element is available within the SVG DOM. You can attach JavaScript event handlers for an element.

In SVG, each drawn shape is remembered as an object. If attributes of an SVG object are changed, the browser can automatically re-render the shape.

Canvas is rendered pixel by pixel. In canvas, once the graphic is drawn, it is forgotten by the browser.

If its position should be changed, the entire scene needs to be redrawn, including any objects that might have been covered by the graphic.

-->

      <!--  Comparison of Canvas and SVG
The table below shows some important differences between Canvas and SVG:

Canvas:	
Resolution dependent
No support for event handlers
Poor text rendering capabilities
You can save the resulting image as .png or .jpg
Well suited for graphic-intensive games

SVG:
Resolution independent
Support for event handlers
Best suited for applications with large rendering areas (Google Maps)
Slow rendering if complex (anything that uses the DOM a lot will be slow)
Not suited for game applications

        <!-- HTML5 Video Example

            Before HTML5, a video could only be played in a browser with a plug-in (like flash).

      The HTML5 <video> element specifies a standard way to embed a video in a web page.

            <video width="320" height="240" controls>
  <source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

           * How it Works *
The controls attribute adds video controls, like play, pause, and volume.

It is a good idea to always include width and height attributes. If height and width are not set, the page might flicker while the video loads.

The <source> element allows you to specify alternative video files which the browser may choose from. The browser will use the first recognized format.

The text between the <video> and </video> tags will only be displayed in browsers that do not support the <video> element.
           
            
             To start a video automatically use the autoplay attribute:
                                               |
                                             vvvvv
                                               v
            <video width="320" height="240" autoplay>
  <source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
            The autoplay attribute does not work in mobile devices like iPad and iPhone.

            HTML Video - Browser Support
In HTML5, there are 3 supported video formats: MP4, WebM, and Ogg.

The browser support for the different formats is:

Browser     MP4    WebM    Ogg
Internet
Explorer    YES      NO     NO
Chrome      YES	     YES    YES
Firefox     YES      YES    YES
Safari      YES	     NO     NO
Opera       YES      YES    YES
      (from Opera 25)

            HTML Video - Methods, Properties, and Events
HTML5 defines DOM methods, properties, and events for the <video> element.

This allows you to load, play, and pause videos, as well as setting duration and volume.

There are also DOM events that can notify you when a video begins to play, is paused, etc.

            Example: Using JavaScript
            ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

            <div style="text-align:center">
  <button onclick="playPause()">Play/Pause</button>
  <button onclick="makeBig()">Big</button>
  <button onclick="makeSmall()">Small</button>
  <button onclick="makeNormal()">Normal</button>
  <br><br>
  <video id="video1" width="420">
    <source src="mov_bbb.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    <source src="mov_bbb.ogg" type="video/ogg">
    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
  </video>
</div>

<script>
var myVideo = document.getElementById("video1");

function playPause() {
    if (myVideo.paused)
        myVideo.play();
    else
        myVideo.pause();
}

function makeBig() {
    myVideo.width = 560;
}

function makeSmall() {
    myVideo.width = 320;
}

function makeNormal() {
    myVideo.width = 420;
}
</script>

      <!--  HTML5 Audio

          Audio on the Web
Before HTML5, audio files could only be played in a browser with a plug-in (like flash).

The HTML5 <audio> element specifies a standard way to embed audio in a web page.

        The HTML <audio> Element

          <audio controls>
  <source src="horse.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
  <source src="horse.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>

          HTML Audio - How It Works
The controls attribute adds audio controls, like play, pause, and volume.

The <source> element allows you to specify alternative audio files which the browser may choose from. The browser will use the first recognized format.

The text between the <audio> and </audio> tags will only be displayed in browsers that do not support the <audio> element.

          HTML Audio - Browser Support
In HTML5, there are 3 supported audio formats: MP3, Wav, and Ogg.

The browser support for the different formats is: 

Browser	    MP3	    Wav	   Ogg
Internet
Explorer    YES	    NO     NO
Chrome      YES     YES	   YES
Firefox	    YES	    YES	   YES

Opera       YES     YES    YES
          
          HTML Audio - Methods, Properties, and Events
HTML5 defines DOM methods, properties, and events for the <audio> element.

This allows you to load, play, and pause audios, as well as set duration and volume.

There are also DOM events that can notify you when an audio begins to play, is paused, etc.

          HTML5 Audio Tags
Tag        	Description
<audio>	  Defines sound content
<source>  Defines multiple media resources for media elements, such as <video> and <audio>

          Your browser does not support the audio element.
      </audio>

      <!--End of Audio Example-->

      <!--HTML Helpers (Plug-ins)
Helper applications (plug-ins) are computer programs that extend the standard functionality of a web browser.

Examples of well-known plug-ins are Java applets.

Plug-ins can be added to web pages with the <object> tag or the <embed> tag. 

Plug-ins can be used for many purposes: display maps, scan for viruses, verify your bank id, etc.

To display video and audio: Use the <video> and <audio> tags.

          The <object> Element
The <object> element is supported by all browsers.

The <object> element defines an embedded object within an HTML document.

It is used to embed plug-ins (like Java applets, PDF readers, Flash Players) in web pages.

Example:  <object width="400" height="50" data="bookmark.swf"></object>

        The <object> element can also be used to include HTML in HTML:
          <object width="100%" height="500px" data="snippet.html"></object>

Or images if you like: <object data="audi.jpeg"></object>
         
          The <embed> Element
The <embed> element is supported in all major browsers.

The <embed> element also defines an embedded object within an HTML document.

Web browsers have supported the <embed> element for a long time. However, it has not been a part of the HTML specification before HTML5.

Example: <embed width="400" height="50" src="bookmark.swf">

          Note that the <embed> element does not have a closing tag. It can not contain alternative text.

The <embed> element can also be used to include HTML in HTML:

Example: <embed width="100%" height="500px" src="snippet.html">

Or images if you like:

Example: <embed src="audi.jpeg">

      HTML YouTube Videos Example

          The easiest way to play videos in HTML, is to use YouTube.

Struggling with Video Formats?
Earlier in this tutorial, you have seen that you might have to convert your videos to different formats to make them play in all browsers.

Converting videos to different formats can be difficult and time-consuming.

An easier solution is to let YouTube play the videos in your web page.

YouTube Video Id
YouTube will display an id (like XGSy3_Czz8k), when you save (or play) a video.
You can use this id, and refer to your video in the HTML code.

Playing a YouTube Video in HTML
To play your video on a web page, do the following:

Upload the video to YouTube
Take a note of the video id
Define an <iframe> element in your web page
Let the src attribute point to the video URL
Use the width and height attributes to specify the dimension of the player
Add any other parameters to the URL (see below)
Example - Using iFrame (recommended)

<iframe width="420" height="315"
src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XGSy3_Czz8k">
</iframe>


          YouTube Autoplay
You can have your video start playing automatically when a user visits that page by adding a simple parameter to your YouTube URL.

Note: Take careful consideration when deciding to autoplay your videos. Automatically starting a video can annoy your visitor and end up causing more harm than good.

Value 0 (default): The video will not play automatically when the player loads.
Value 1: The video will play automatically when the player loads.

YouTube - Autoplay

<iframe width="420" height="315"
src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XGSy3_Czz8k?autoplay=1">
</iframe>

          YouTube Playlist
A comma separated list of videos to play (in addition to the original URL).

YouTube Loop
Value 0 (default): The video will play only once.
Value 1: The video will loop (forever).

YouTube - Loop

<iframe width="420" height="315"
src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XGSy3_Czz8k?playlist=XGSy3_Czz8k&loop=1">
</iframe>
          
          YouTube Controls
Value 0: Player controls does not display.
Value 1 (default): Player controls display.

YouTube - Controls

<iframe width="420" height="315"
src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XGSy3_Czz8k?controls=0">
</iframe>

          YouTube - Using <object> or <embed>
Note: YouTube <object> and <embed> were deprecated from January 2015. You should migrate your videos to use <iframe> instead.

Example - Using <object> (deprecated)

<object width="420" height="315"
data="http://www.youtube.com/embed/XGSy3_Czz8k">
</object>

          Example - Using <embed> (deprecated)

<embed width="420" height="315"
src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/XGSy3_Czz8k">

-->


      <object width="420" height="315"
              data="http://www.youtube.com/embed/XGSy3_Czz8k"></object>



      <embed width="420" height="315"
             src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/XGSy3_Czz8k">
