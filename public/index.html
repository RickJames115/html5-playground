        HTML5 - New Attribute Syntax
        HTML5 allows four different syntaxes for attributes.

        This example demonstrates the different syntaxes used in an <input> tag:

        Type               Example
        Empty                  <input type="text" value="John" disabled>
        Unquoted               <input type="text" value=John>
        Double-quoted          <input type="text" value="John Doe">
        Single-quoted          <input type="text" value='John Doe'>
        In HTML5, all four syntaxes may be used, depending on what is needed for the attribute.

        HTML5 Graphics
          Tag                Description
        <canvas>        Draw graphics, on the fly, via scripting (usually JavaScript)

                          Semantics is the study of the meanings of words and phrases in a language.

                Semantic elements = elements with a meaning.

                What are Semantic Elements?
                A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.

                Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content.

                Examples of semantic elements: <form>, <table>, and <article> - Clearly defines its content.

                          New Semantic Elements in HTML5
                Many web sites contain HTML code like: <div id="nav"> <div class="header"> <div id="footer">
                to indicate navigation, header, and footer.

                HTML5 offers new semantic elements to define different parts of a web page:

                <article>
                <aside>
                <details>
                <figcaption>
                <figure>
                <footer>
                <header>
                <main>
                <mark>
                <nav>
                <section>
                <summary>
                <time>


                HTML5 Semantic Elements
                                              HTML5 <section> Element
                The <section> element defines a section in a document.

                According to W3C's HTML5 documentation: "A section is a thematic grouping of content, typically with a heading."
                A home page could normally be split into sections for introduction, content, and contact information.

                Example:

                <section>
                  <h1>WWF</h1>
                  <p>The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) is....</p>
                </section>

                                              HTML5 <article> Element

                The <article> element specifies independent, self-contained content.
                An article should make sense on its own, and it should be possible to read it independently from the rest of the web site.

                Examples of where an <article> element can be used:

                Forum post
                Blog post
                Newspaper article
                Example:

                <article>
                  <h1>What Does WWF Do?</h1>
                  <p>WWF's mission is to stop the degradation of our planet's natural environment,
                  and build a future in which humans live in harmony with nature.</p>
                </article>

                                Nesting <article> in <section> or Vice Versa?

                The <article> element specifies independent, self-contained content.
                The <section> element defines section in a document.
                Can we use the definitions to decide how to nest those elements? No, we cannot!
                So, on the Internet, you will find HTML pages with <section> elements containing <article> elements, and <article> elements containing <sections> elements.
                You will also find pages with <section> elements containing <section> elements, and <article> elements containing <article> elements.
                Example for a newspaper: The sport articles in the sport section, may have a technical section in each article.

                                            HTML5 <header> Element

                The <header> element specifies a header for a document or section.
                The <header> element should be used as a container for introductory content.
                You can have several <header> elements in one document.
                The following example defines a header for an article:

                Example:

                <article>
                  <header>
                    <h1>What Does WWF Do?</h1>
                    <p>WWF's mission:</p>
                  </header>
                  <p>WWF's mission is to stop the degradation of our planet's natural environment,
                  and build a future in which humans live in harmony with nature.</p>
                </article>

                                           HTML5 <footer> Element

                The <footer> element specifies a footer for a document or section.
                A <footer> element should contain information about its containing element.
                A footer typically contains the author of the document, copyright information, links to terms of use, contact information, etc.
                You may have several <footer> elements in one document.

                Example:

                <footer>
                  <p>Posted by: Hege Refsnes</p>
                  <p>Contact information: <a href="mailto:someone@example.com">
                  someone@example.com</a>.</p>
                </footer>


                                            HTML5 <nav> Element

                The <nav> element defines a set of navigation links.
                Notice that NOT all links of a document should be inside a <nav> element. The <nav> element is intended only for major block of navigation links.

                Example:

                <nav>
                  <a href="/html/">HTML</a> |
                  <a href="/css/">CSS</a> |
                  <a href="/js/">JavaScript</a> |
                  <a href="/jquery/">jQuery</a>
                </nav>

                                             HTML5 <aside> Element

                The <aside> element defines some content aside from the content it is placed in (like a sidebar).
                The aside content should be related to the surrounding content.

                Example:

                <p>My family and I visited The Epcot center this summer.</p>

                <aside>
                  <h4>Epcot Center</h4>
                  <p>The Epcot Center is a theme park in Disney World, Florida.</p>
                </aside>

                                     HTML5 <figure> and <figcaption> Elements

                The purpose of a figure caption is to add a visual explanation to an image.
                In HTML5, an image and a caption can be grouped together in a <figure> element:

                Example:

                <figure>
                  <img src="pic_mountain.jpg" alt="The Pulpit Rock" width="304" height="228">
                  <figcaption>Fig1. - The Pulpit Rock, Norway.</figcaption>
                </figure>

                The <img> element defines the image, the <figcaption> element defines the caption.


                                              Why Semantic Elements?

                With HTML4, developers used their own id/class names to style elements: header, top, bottom, footer, menu, navigation, main, container, content, article, sidebar, topnav, etc.
                This made it impossible for search engines to identify the correct web page content.
                With the new HTML5 elements (<header> <footer> <nav> <section> <article>), this will become easier.
                According to the W3C, a Semantic Web: "Allows data to be shared and reused across applications, enterprises, and communities."


                                                 Image Attributes

        Always add the "alt" attribute to images. This attribute is important when the image for some reason cannot be displayed.
        Also, always define image width and height. It reduces flickering because the browser can reserve space for the image before loading.
                            -->

    <!--Differences Between SVG and Canvas
    SVG is a language for describing 2D graphics in XML.

    Canvas draws 2D graphics, on the fly (with a JavaScript).

    SVG is XML based, which means that every element is available within the SVG DOM. You can attach JavaScript event handlers for an element.

    In SVG, each drawn shape is remembered as an object. If attributes of an SVG object are changed, the browser can automatically re-render the shape.

    Canvas is rendered pixel by pixel. In canvas, once the graphic is drawn, it is forgotten by the browser.

    If its position should be changed, the entire scene needs to be redrawn, including any objects that might have been covered by the graphic.

    -->
    <!--  Comparison of Canvas and SVG
    The table below shows some important differences between Canvas and SVG:

    Canvas:
    Resolution dependent
    No support for event handlers
    Poor text rendering capabilities
    You can save the resulting image as .png or .jpg
    Well suited for graphic-intensive games

    SVG:
    Resolution independent
    Support for event handlers
    Best suited for applications with large rendering areas (Google Maps)
    Slow rendering if complex (anything that uses the DOM a lot will be slow)
    Not suited for game applications
                 -->
    <!--   Google Maps allows you to display maps on your web page.

    <!-- HTML5 Video Example

                Before HTML5, a video could only be played in a browser with a plug-in (like flash).

          The HTML5 <video> element specifies a standard way to embed a video in a web page.

                <video width="320" height="240" controls>
      <source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
      <source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg">
    Your browser does not support the video tag.
    </video>

               * How it Works *
    The controls attribute adds video controls, like play, pause, and volume.

    It is a good idea to always include width and height attributes. If height and width are not set, the page might flicker while the video loads.

    The <source> element allows you to specify alternative video files which the browser may choose from. The browser will use the first recognized format.

    The text between the <video> and </video> tags will only be displayed in browsers that do not support the <video> element.


                 To start a video automatically use the autoplay attribute:
                                                   |
                                                 vvvvv
                                                   v
                <video width="320" height="240" autoplay>
      <source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
      <source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg">
    Your browser does not support the video tag.
    </video>
                The autoplay attribute does not work in mobile devices like iPad and iPhone.

                HTML Video - Browser Support
    In HTML5, there are 3 supported video formats: MP4, WebM, and Ogg.

    The browser support for the different formats is:

    Browser     MP4    WebM    Ogg
    Internet
    Explorer    YES      NO     NO
    Chrome      YES	     YES    YES
    Firefox     YES      YES    YES
    Safari      YES	     NO     NO
    Opera       YES      YES    YES
          (from Opera 25)

                HTML Video - Methods, Properties, and Events
    HTML5 defines DOM methods, properties, and events for the <video> element.

    This allows you to load, play, and pause videos, as well as setting duration and volume.

    There are also DOM events that can notify you when a video begins to play, is paused, etc.

                Example: Using JavaScript
                ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                <div style="text-align:center">
      <button onclick="playPause()">Play/Pause</button>

      <button onclick="makeSmall()">Small</button>
      <button onclick="makeNormal()">Normal</button>
      <br><br>
      <video id="video1" width="420">
        <source src="mov_bbb.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        <source src="mov_bbb.ogg" type="video/ogg">
        Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
      </video>
    </div>

    <script>
    var myVideo = document.getElementById("video1");

    function playPause() {
        if (myVideo.paused)
            myVideo.play();
        else
            myVideo.pause();
    }

    function makeBig() {
        myVideo.width = 560;
    }

    function makeSmall() {
        myVideo.width = 320;
    }

    function makeNormal() {
        myVideo.width = 420;
    }
    </script>

    <!--  HTML5 Audio

              Audio on the Web
    Before HTML5, audio files could only be played in a browser with a plug-in (like flash).

    The HTML5 <audio> element specifies a standard way to embed audio in a web page.

            The HTML <audio> Element

              <audio controls>
      <source src="horse.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
      <source src="horse.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
    Your browser does not support the audio element.
    </audio>

              HTML Audio - How It Works
    The controls attribute adds audio controls, like play, pause, and volume.

    The <source> element allows you to specify alternative audio files which the browser may choose from. The browser will use the first recognized format.

    The text between the <audio> and </audio> tags will only be displayed in browsers that do not support the <audio> element.

              HTML Audio - Browser Support
    In HTML5, there are 3 supported audio formats: MP3, Wav, and Ogg.

    The browser support for the different formats is:

    Browser	    MP3	    Wav	   Ogg
    Internet
    Explorer    YES	    NO     NO
    Chrome      YES     YES	   YES

        <!--HTML Helpers (Plug-ins)
        Helper applications (plug-ins) are computer programs that extend the standard functionality of a web browser.

        Examples of well-known plug-ins are Java applets.

        Plug-ins can be added to web pages with the <object> tag or the <embed> tag.

        Plug-ins can be used for many purposes: display maps, scan for viruses, verify your bank id, etc.

        To display video and audio: Use the <video> and <audio> tags.

                  The <object> Element
        The <object> element is supported by all browsers.

        The <object> element defines an embedded object within an HTML document.

        It is used to embed plug-ins (like Java applets, PDF readers, Flash Players) in web pages.

        Example:  <object width="400" height="50" data="bookmark.swf"></object>

                The <object> element can also be used to include HTML in HTML:
                  <object width="100%" height="500px" data="snippet.html"></object>

        Or images if you like: <object data="audi.jpeg"></object>

                  The <embed> Element
        The <embed> element is supported in all major browsers.

        The <embed> element also defines an embedded object within an HTML document.

        Web browsers have supported the <embed> element for a long time. However, it has not been a part of the HTML specification before HTML5.

        Example: <embed width="400" height="50" src="bookmark.swf">

                  Note that the <embed> element does not have a closing tag. It can not contain alternative text.

        The <embed> element can also be used to include HTML in HTML:

        Example: <embed width="100%" height="500px" src="snippet.html">

        Or images if you like:

        Example: <embed src="audi.jpeg">



        -->
        <object width="400" height="50" data="bookmark.swf"></object>

              HTML YouTube Videos Example

                  The easiest way to play videos in HTML, is to use YouTube.

        Struggling with Video Formats?
        Earlier in this tutorial, you have seen that you might have to convert your videos to different formats to make them play in all browsers.

        Converting videos to different formats can be difficult and time-consuming.

        An easier solution is to let YouTube play the videos in your web page.

        YouTube Video Id
        YouTube will display an id (like XGSy3_Czz8k), when you save (or play) a video.
        You can use this id, and refer to your video in the HTML code.

        Playing a YouTube Video in HTML
        To play your video on a web page, do the following:

        Upload the video to YouTube
        Take a note of the video id
        Define an <iframe> element in your web page
        Let the src attribute point to the video URL
        Use the width and height attributes to specify the dimension of the player
        Add any other parameters to the URL (see below)
        Example - Using iFrame (recommended)

        <iframe width="420" height="315"
        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XGSy3_Czz8k">
        </iframe>


                  YouTube Autoplay
        You can have your video start playing automatically when a user visits that page by adding a simple parameter to your YouTube URL.

        Note: Take careful consideration when deciding to autoplay your videos. Automatically starting a video can annoy your visitor and end up causing more harm than good.

        Value 0 (default): The video will not play automatically when the player loads.
        Value 1: The video will play automatically when the player loads.

        YouTube - Autoplay

        <iframe width="420" height="315"
        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XGSy3_Czz8k?autoplay=1">
        </iframe>

                  YouTube Playlist
        A comma separated list of videos to play (in addition to the original URL).

        YouTube Loop
        Value 0 (default): The video will play only once.
        Value 1: The video will loop (forever).

        YouTube - Loop

        <iframe width="420" height="315"
        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XGSy3_Czz8k?playlist=XGSy3_Czz8k&loop=1">
        </iframe>

                  YouTube Controls
        Value 0: Player controls does not display.
        Value 1 (default): Player controls display.

        YouTube - Controls

        <iframe width="420" height="315"
        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XGSy3_Czz8k?controls=0">
        </iframe>

                  YouTube - Using <object> or <embed>
        Note: YouTube <object> and <embed> were deprecated from January 2015. You should migrate your videos to use <iframe> instead.

        Example - Using <object> (deprecated)

        <object width="420" height="315"
        data="http://www.youtube.com/embed/XGSy3_Czz8k">
        </object>

                  Example - Using <embed> (deprecated)

        <embed width="420" height="315"
        src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/XGSy3_Czz8k">

        -->

        <object width="420" height="315"
                data="http://www.youtube.com/embed/XGSy3_Czz8k"></object>


        <embed width="420" height="315"
               src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/XGSy3_Czz8k">
